#  📡 **ZkWave: Transforming Voice into Secure Proofs** 🎤🔐

## 🚀 **Overview**

**ZkWave** is an innovative project that combines audio signal processing, polynomial mathematics, and zero-knowledge cryptography. With **ZkWave**, we securely convert voice data into mathematical polynomials and leverage **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** to verify voice-based information without exposing sensitive data.

## 💡 **Features**

- 🎧 **Voice-to-Polynomial Transformation**  
  Transform audio signals into polynomials for efficient compression, encryption, and secure representation.

- 🔒 **Privacy-Preserving Voice Authentication**  
  Authenticate users through voice securely using zero-knowledge cryptography.

- 🛡️ **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**  
  Enable secure and private proof generation using zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs.

## 📚 **How It Works**

1. **Voice Signal Processing**  
   - Record and digitize voice input (WAV format).
   - Preprocess the audio for noise reduction and normalization.

2. **Polynomial Representation**  
   - Model voice signals as mathematical polynomials using least squares approximation or spline fitting.
   - Compress voice features into polynomial coefficients.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
   - Generate ZKPs for the polynomial representation using **Circom** and **snarkjs**.
   - Verify proofs without revealing the underlying voice data.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language:** Rust 🦀  
- **Cryptographic Framework:** Circom, snarkjs 🔐  
- **Audio Processing:** Rust's `wav` and `ndarray` crates  
- **Blockchain Integration (Optional):** zkSync for decentralized verification
